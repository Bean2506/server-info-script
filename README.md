Possibly the most simple script out there. Use this script to allow members to find out your servers, discord, teamspeak and website!

I created this script years ago and I have seen people asking for a release, yet it is only about 6 lines of code, and is just a client sided approach. :/

* HOW TO CONFIGURE *
1) Drag file into resources folder.
2) Open your cfg file and type, Start server-info-script
3) Open the c-config.lua file
4) Input your servers information in the fields
5) Save and start your server. 


**** READ ME ****
This script should not need updating therefore I give no permission for anyone to re-release this script. However, I will allow people to further develop this script, as long as original credit is given.
